## Overview

Welcome to the Off-Platform Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts, created as part of the Codecademy curriculum for the Full-Stack Engineering Path. 
This project focuses on building a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store. I was not given much guidance, instead I was expected to use Codecademy, the internet, and any other resources I needed.
This was one of the first projects I completed.

I was required to create a folder structure that made sense, an HTML file, and a CSS file.
